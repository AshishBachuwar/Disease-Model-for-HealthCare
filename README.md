This project refers to the most common diseases and their associated symptoms and to develop a disease model. Developed a disease model, by writing SQL operational/analytical queries, designed and developed OLTP and OLAP models for entity analysis, and visualized data using PowerBI

• Designed and developed OLTP and OLAP models for entity analysis.

• Utilized SQL and performed DML operations, and operational queries, and loaded the data using the ELT process. 

• Visualized using PowerBI tool and architected AWS architecture utilizing AWS lambda, AWS RDS, S3, DynamoDB, Glue, Redshift, and Elasticsearch. 

• The model developed provided a base for the stakeholders to work with i.e., Identified and predicted disease trends; Healthcare organizations and policymakers were able to prioritize public health initiatives and allocated resources more efficiently based on the diseases identified/predicted.
